## Overview

`polysemy` is a library for writing high-power, low-boilerplate, zero-cost,
domain specific languages. It allows you to separate your business logic from
your implementation details. And in doing so, `polysemy` lets you turn your
implementation code into reusable library code.

It's like `mtl` but composes better, requires less boilerplate, and avoids the
O(n^2) instances problem.

It's like `freer-simple` but more powerful and 700x faster.

It's like `fused-effects` but with an order of magnitude less boilerplate.


## Features

* *Effects are higher-order,* meaning it's trivial to write `bracket` and `local`
    as first-class effects.
* *Effects are low-boilerplate,* meaning you can create new effects in a
    single-digit number of lines. New interpreters are nothing but functions and
    pattern matching.
* *Effects are zero-cost,* meaning that GHC<sup>[1](#fn1)</sup> can optimize
    away the entire abstraction at compile time.


<a name="fn1">1</a>: Unfortunately this is not true in GHC 8.6.3, but will be
true as soon as [my patch](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/merge_requests/668/) lands.


## Examples

Console effect:

```haskell
{-# LANGAUGE TemplateHaskell #-}

import Polysemy

data Console m a where
  GetLine :: Console m String
  PutLine :: String -> Console m ()

makeSemantic ''Console

runConsoleIO :: Member (Lift IO) r => Semantic (Console ': r) a -> Semantic r a
runConsoleIO = interpret $ \case
  GetLine     -> sendM getLine
  PutLine msg -> sendM $ putStrLn msg
```


Resource effect:

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell #-}

import qualified Control.Exception as X
import           Polysemy

data Resource m a where
  Bracket :: m a -> (a -> m ()) -> (a -> m b) -> Resource m b

makeSemantic ''Resource

runResource
    :: forall r a
     . Member (Lift IO) r
    => (âˆ€ x. Semantic r x -> IO x)
    -> Semantic (Resource ': r) a
    -> Semantic r a
runResource finish = interpretH $ \case
  Bracket alloc dealloc use -> do
    a <- runT  alloc
    d <- bindT dealloc
    u <- bindT use

    let runIt :: Semantic (Resource ': r) x -> IO x
        runIt = finish .@ runResource

    sendM $ X.bracket (runIt a) (runIt . d) (runIt . u)
```

Easy.
